# Store Service

**Store Service** is a spring boot application designed for straightforward store inventory management. It comprises three main classes: `Store`, `Stock`, and `ProductsConsumptions`. It is built using Java Spring Boot and MySQL database. Lombok minimizes code, Maven simplifies project management, and API documentation is facilitated via Swagger.
- Note: Its part of a graduation project of Fawry internship.
- All microservices that make the entire ecommerce are here: [fawry final project](https://github.com/Fawry-Project)

# Features
- **Store Operations:** Utilize the `store` class to effortless CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to manage store details.
- **Stock tracking:** The `Stock` class ensures efficient inventory control by managing product quantities within the store.
- **Products Consumptions:** Track stock quantity changes over time with the `ProductsConsumptions` class, maintaining a reliable change history. got it by calling `product service`. 
- Validate products for 'order service' to check if the product quantity is valid

    git clone https://github.com/salmaahmed0/store-api.git
    cd store-api
   ```
2. Configure the database:
   -- Create a MySQL database and update the `application.properties` file under `src/main/resources` with your database configuration:
  ```
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:3306/your_database
    spring.datasource.username=your_username
    spring.datasource.password=your_password
  ```
3. Build and run the application:
  ```
    mvn spring-boot:run
  ```
After run the project you can test it from links in `Test the API` above.
